# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results
This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with MongoDB's `$in` operator when used with an empty array.  The query returns no results even if the field exists in the documents.

## Bug
The `$in` operator is incorrectly used with an empty array, resulting in no results being returned from the query, regardless of whether the field exists.

## Solution
The solution involves checking whether the array is empty before executing the query.  If empty, use a different approach to ensure no unwanted behavior.
